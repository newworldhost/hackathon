   - Users can toggle the visibility of the weather app using a **button** in the on the page, which hides or shows the entire weather app section.

### 8. **Geolocation Error Handling**
   
   - If geolocation is not supported or if there is an error fetching the location, users are presented with a clear error message to inform them of the issue.

### 9. **No Need for Manual Updates**
   - Once the weather data is fetched for either a city or current location, the app automatically updates and displays the relevant information in real-time.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**:
   - Users can enter the name of a city in the search bar or click the **"Get Current Location Weather"** button to retrieve weather information based on their current location.

2. **Weather Fetching**:
   - The app communicates with the **OpenWeather API** to fetch the current weather data for the specified city or geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

3. **Display of Data**:
   - Once the data is retrieved, the app displays the weather conditions in a structured format, including temperature, humidity, wind, and additional details.
   - The app also loads an interactive Google Map that highlights the requested location.

4. **Dynamic Weather Styling**:
   - The app adjusts its appearance based on the weather conditions. For example, on a sunny day, the background turns bright yellow, while on a rainy day, it becomes blue and cool.
  
## Testing 

During the development stages of this webpage and the javascript app itself, I have ensured that feature testing, interactivity and responsivity has been checked prior to each commit made on the project repository. Due to current GitHub limitations, these are not publicly visible commits but can be shown upon request and will be made public once the corresponding GH account is usable again by external viewers.

## Testing Plan

To ensure the functionality and quality of the features, the following tests have/will be performed:

### **1. Testing the "Search Weather by City" Feature**
#### **Test Cases:**
- ✅ **City Name Validation:**  
  - Test the input field with valid city names (e.g., "London", "Paris") to ensure the weather data loads correctly.
  - Test the input field with invalid city names (e.g., "InvalidCity") to ensure the app handles errors and displays an error message (e.g., "City not found").
- ✅ **Button Click Behavior:**  
  - Ensure the "Get Weather" button triggers the weather fetch and correctly updates the UI with temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- ✅ **Empty Input Handling:**  
  - Test that submitting an empty input field displays a message prompting the user to enter a city name.

### **2. Testing the "Display Current Location Weather" Feature**
#### **Test Cases:**
- ✅ **Geolocation Permission:**  
  - Test on browsers with geolocation support to ensure the app prompts for location access and correctly fetches weather data.
  - Test what happens when the user denies location access (e.g., show an appropriate error message like "Location access denied").
- ✅ **Error Handling for Unsupported Browsers:**  
  - Test on browsers without geolocation support to ensure an error message (e.g., "Geolocation is not supported by your browser") is displayed.
- ✅ **Weather Data Display:**  
  - Test that after obtaining the user's location, the weather data is fetched and displayed correctly (temperature, wind, humidity, etc.).

### **3. Testing the "Display Interactive Map" Feature**
#### **Test Cases:**
- ✅ **Map Initialization:**  
  - Verify that the map loads correctly with the right center coordinates (location of the weather).
  - Test that the map zoom level is appropriate (e.g., zoomed in to a street-level view for a city).
- ✅ **Marker Display:**  
  - Ensure a marker is added at the correct location based on the weather data.
- ✅ **Responsive Map:**  
  - Test the map on different screen sizes to ensure it is responsive and fits the layout properly.

### **4. Testing the "Show Weather Details with a Visual Indicator" Feature**
#### **Test Cases:**
- ✅ **Weather Icon Display:**  
  - Test different weather conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy, snowy) to ensure the correct icons are displayed.
  - Test that icons appear clearly and appropriately sized.
- ✅ **Background Color Changes:**  
  - Test that the background color changes according to the weather condition (e.g., sunny = yellow, rainy = blue).
  - Test that the background color transition is smooth and visually appealing.
- ✅ **Temperature Display:**  
  - Verify that the temperature is clearly displayed in large, bold text.
  - Test that the temperature updates based on the correct unit (Celsius) and reflects the current weather.

### **5. General Usability and Performance Tests**
#### **Test Cases:**
- ✅ **Cross-Browser Testing:**  
  - Ensure the app works across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and handles any inconsistencies.
- ✅ **Mobile Responsiveness:**  
  - Test the app on various mobile devices to ensure it is responsive and maintains usability.
- ✅ **API Response Time:**  
  - Check that the app handles slow API responses gracefully and displays an appropriate loading message while waiting for data.
- ✅ **Error Handling:**  
  - Test scenarios where the API fails or is unreachable to ensure proper error messages are displayed to the user.

### Unfixed Bugs

I am not currently aware of any major feature bugs across my page or my javascript feature itself that curerntly exist, however there are a small handful of issue flags in browser devtools highlighting some parts of my code that can be refined with how I have defined certain constants or segments of a function. I can confirm that despite these flags, my feature is still functioning exactly as I had intended it to and I have attempted to stress test the preview version of the page by requesting lots of locations in a short period of time, and it successfully keeps the results and map location shown up to date.

I am aware of a potential flaw with the size of the hero image, not due to any design error, but simply the nature of that image existing on the page will give the page something heavier to load, slightly lowering the lighthouse score in just that category. Other performance factors, SEO and readability all score healthily near 100. I could address this issue by adding code to mark the image to load last as a low priority to ensure the building of the rest of the page and, most importantly, the app itself being loaded hastily. I have in the meantime ensured the image is optimised with a reduced resolution, file size, and is in WEBP format.

Deployment being unavailable will be discussed below, but in theoretical sense, on a deployed live version of my application webpage, I would repeat similar test and review the devtools console to analyse any potential errors, faults or inefficiencies in how the page loads and runs.

## Deployment


- The site is to be deployed to GitHub pages when a resolution is reached over technical difficulties. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

The live link can be found here - (This will be updated in future to support a live page)
